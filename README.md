# Forest-Cover-Type-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
Forest Cover Type Classification Using Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify forest cover types based on geospatial data.

Overview
Developed a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to predict forest cover types.

Implemented comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning for optimised model performance.

Evaluated results with classification reports, confusion matrices, and accuracy metrics to ensure reliability.
